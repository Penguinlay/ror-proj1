# Application Notes

## Below are detail implementations, limitations, assumptions, and/or known bugs.

---

### Custom Implementations
(differed from ` README.md `'s instructions)

1. Attack button is not implemented on all the pages. It is excluded from current user's own trainer profile so that current trainer can't attack its own Pokemon.

---

### Known limitations

1. If the automatically populated Pokemons are gone, you can't catch a Pokemon; instead, you must create your owns.

2. New users cannot set their own names and custom url yet.

3. There is no restriction on when you can heal and attack yet. So, it's possible to heal a Pokemon to full health at any given time.
